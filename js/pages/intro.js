var text_string_01 = "Welcome to the Vermont 2 Alaska Trip Talk.  For years my buddy Elwin has been talking about " +
    "taking this trip. He took a similar trip in a pickup truck as a young man with his cousin, and since then he’s " +
    "wanted to go again, but this time on a motorcycle.";

var text_string_02 = "The reason why decades went by between Elwin’s first trip and this one is a Dairy Farm.  If you had ever watched " +
    "Elwin on his farm tending 200+ head of cattle, milking 75 Holsteins twice a day, planting corn, cutting hay, and " +
    "keeping the machines and buildings functional, you’d understand why his ‘time off’ wasn’t much longer than " +
    "dinner in town with his wife Angela.";

var text_string_03 = "Eventually some combination of the volatile milk market, the thrashing the farm took from" +
    " hurricane Irene, and the physical toll of 100+ hour workweeks finally convinced him to sell " +
    "the dairy cows.   (Of course some hounding by Angela and me may have helped too.) The bottom line is he has " +
    "transformed the farm into a very successful beef and pork business.";

var text_string_04 = "Late in 2012 I told Elwin if he gave me one year to get my motorcycle-act together I could be " +
    "ready this year for this trip.  It’s been a whirlwind year studying bikes and gear while trying to get more riding " +
    "experience but here we go.  On this web site we will try to upload pictures and a few comments about where we are " +
    "and what’s happening so family and friends can ride along with us.";

var text_string_05 = "Already there are some folks I need to thank for helping me get it all together in a relatively " +
    "short amount of time.";

var text_string_06 = "For starters this web site is designed and handled by my brother John.  All I do is send him " +
    "some stuff and he makes it look great.  I’ve been blessed with tech-savvy brothers and I’d be mailing postcards " +
    "if John hadn’t volunteered to connect the pixels for me.";

var text_string_07 = "Next is my motorcycle guru, Ken.  As soon as I knew this trip was in the making I inundated him " +
    "with emails about bikes, equip, gear, etc.  He’s been extremely patient and generous with his time, knowledge " +
    "and mechanical skills, and launched me efficiently in the right direction and has kept me on task to date.  I " +
    "would not have made it to this point without him.";

var text_string_08 = "The members on the forum Stromtrooper.com have extensive experience with the V-Strom, and they " +
    "have debated, tried, and answered any question about this bike that might have crossed my mind.  As for clothing " +
    "options, Anthony at Revzilla.com can tour a piece of gear as if he’d manufactured it that morning himself.";

var text_string_09 = "I added a bunch of stuff to the bike in a short amount of time and although I’m mechanically " +
    "handy I don’t know near enough for what this bike needed.  My mechanic Dave tireworks180@gmail.com did a brilliant " +
    "job of connecting all the dots, balancing everything mechanically and electrically, and making sure all was in " +
    "order before departure.";

var text_string_10 = "Most of all I need to thank Elwin's wife Angela and their son Forest.  They will be juggling the " +
    "farm details while Elwin is on the road.";
