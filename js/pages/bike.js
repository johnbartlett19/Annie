var text_string_01 = "<h2>The Bike</h2>";

var text_string_02 = "My bike is a Suzuki V-Strom 650 cc and because it’s the little brother of the 1000 cc version " +
    "it’s commonly referred to as a Wee-Strom.  I call mine “Wee-V”.  This model has been around for years, (’84?) and " +
    "it’s gone anywhere anyone can think of going.  If you need an aftermarket part you’ll find it on the web because " +
    "someone else has already thought of it and manufactured it.";

var text_string_03 = "‘Farkle’ is a term that covers most anything you add to a bike.  " +
    "The <a href='http://www.urbandictionary.com'>urban dictionary</a> says it’s cross between function and sparkle. " +
    "A year ago I knew nothing about Farkling, now I’ve Farkled the foo out of one motorcycle.  The dictionary also " +
    "says it stands for, ‘Fancy Accessory, Really Kool, Likely Expensive’, and here’s proof.";

var text_string_04 = "<b>Engine Guard and Skid Plate</b> - Ken helped me put on the engine guards and skid plate, " +
    "the small stuff I added myself and the rest has been expertly handled by my mechanic " +
    "<a href=mailto://tireworks180@gmail.com>Dave</a>. He’s in the South East corner of Vermont.";

var text_string_05 = "<b>Luggage & Rack</b> - I agonized for days over what luggage system to use.  With no prior " +
    "experience they all looked good. Since I am a relatively new rider I figured the bike was going to tip over a " +
    "few times and I needed luggage to handle that.  I already owned the 1510 Pelican box with the lid organizer " +
    "and liked the quality and thought it would look good as a trunk.  Caribou sells a complete Pelican package " +
    "with a Hepco-Becker rack.  All together with the engine guards it’s like I have a mini roll cage for the bike." +
    "The one downside is capacity for a big trip.  I’ve had to add soft bags for what won’t fit in the Pelicans." +
    "<p>I also agonized over the tank bag.  The Bags-Connection bag is beautiful but VERY expensive.  However it " +
    "fits great, looks great and has very good capacity.  It’s on a quick disconnect to a tankring and has locks " +
    "for the bag and the zipper.";

var text_string_06 = "<b>Windscreen & Mirror Extenders</b> - From what I read the V-strom windscreen appears to be " +
    "known for buffeting the driver.  I put the Madstad bracket on to give me more adjustment options and that " +
    "took the pat, pat, pat off my helmet but I was still getting a push, push, push on my shoulders.   Many of " +
    "the aftermarket windscreens are a bit too tall for me so I added the laminar lip.  The lip helped my shoulders " +
    "but didn’t totally eliminate it.  While commuting this spring I realized ½ of the shoulder wind issue was from " +
    "the mirrors so I changed them out and that softened the blow. Without the mirror extenders the view is mostly " +
    "of my shoulders.";

var text_string_07 = "<b>Koubalinks</b> - Because the V-strom is a Dual-sport category bike it carries it’s weight " +
    "higher than Sport-road bikes and for me that meant a couple things.  First I could only touch the front of my " +
    "feet when stopped and I have close to a 32” inseam.  In addition when I was riding on dirt roads I felt like " +
    "a circus bear on top of a tiny bicycle where one wrong move and I’d flop right over.  My mechanic Dave lowered " +
    "it 1”, balanced the front fork to match and what came out of the shop was a whole new bike.  It lost most " +
    "of it’s squirrely feel in the dirt road corner, it lost the sensation that if I tipped it more than 3 degrees " +
    "it was going to topple over on my leg, and now I can sit with both feet virtually flat on the ground.";

var text_string_08 = "<b>Sidestand Footplate</b> - At it’s original height I thought the bike tipped too far on the " +
    "side stand so I added AltRider’s footplate to the bottom of the stand.  When the bike was lowered I had to take " +
    "the foot plate off because it was too upright.  Now the footplate is clamped to my center stand so that I have " +
    "a much bigger platform on which to press as I struggle to haul up the rear end while engaging the stand. " +
    "Brilliant!;";

var text_string_09 = "<b>Bar Riser & Seat Pad</b> - The bike is very comfortable with the handlebars in the " +
    "original position however with my arm length it means I’m sitting at the very front of the seat and sliding " +
    "slightly forward into the tank.  For a short ride it’s OK, but for longer rides there’s a bit too much " +
    "pressure on some soft tissue.  The bar risers put me farther back on the seat where it’s a bit wider.  " +
    "Just in case I have a seat pad I’ll use if my sit bones wear out.  The Airhawk-R is made by Roho, and that " +
    "company has extensive experience making seat pads for wheelchairs.";

var text_string_10 = "<b>Spare Gas</b> - The extra gas can probably won’t get filled until somewhere northeast " +
    "of Edmonton.  I’m hoping we’ll never need it but it will be nice to have an extra gallon if we miscalculate.";

var text_string_11 = "<b>Levers</b> - The two finger levers are what I’m used to on my mountain bicycles and " +
    "everything else feels gargantuan.  I ordered them on short notice last June when I crushed the end of my " +
    "left ring finger and had it splinted to the point of interfering with the lever motion.";

var text_string_12 = "<b>Electrical</b> - Ken & Dave said I needed a Power Distribution Module.  I don’t have " +
    "the capacity to explain why, just go with it.  Dave put one 12v outlet into the dashboad.  I have a " +
    "splitter cable I’ll run from there into the tank bag.";

var text_string_13 = "<b>Torpedo Tubes</b> - I have 3 torpedo tubes.  One was attached to my brush hog and I " +
    "bought the other two.  The right one will have the chain lube & brush, the left one is for drinks, and " +
    "the rear one is the ‘Toilet Tube’ so no one has to tear open luggage just to find a square of toilet paper.";

var text_string_14 = "<b>Bulbs</b> - I thought it would be cool to have LED turn signal and brake bulbs.  " +
    "Apparently I thought wrong.  After trying a few different ones the verdict is the original bulbs are " +
    "brighter at more angles.  The brake modulator has a number of different braking blink patterns but without " +
    "LED bulbs the faster patterns probably are out.  Maybe someone will give me advice on this dilemma " +
    "along the way.  I hope the stutter blink doesn’t drive Allen nuts if he’s riding second." +
    "<p>I put the turn signals farther back so the rear plate wouldn't hide them as much.  Ken said he was having " +
        "trouble seeing them in the position the bracket's original position put them.</p>";

var text_string_15 = "<b>Throttle Lock</b> - I hesitated putting out the cash for the Kaoko throttle however I’m " +
    "already glad I did.  Even on my hour commute to work I get sick of having my right hand in a constant " +
    "position.  I just had to trim a bit of the grip off at the end to get the contact right and it was working " +
    "in no time.";

var text_string_16 = "<b>Grip Heaters</b> - I read everyone’s comments and settled on the Oxfords.  They really " +
    "heat up although the right is not nearly as hot at the left and I really need it the other way around if it’s " +
    "cold.  It’s probably just a function of heat dissipating from the throttle tube on the right, right?  " +
    "If I ever need to replace the grips I think I’d go with the ‘sports’ model.  I think I’d like the nubby " +
    "surface better than this.";

var text_string_17 = "<b>Front Turn Signals</b> - The OEM signals look fine, until you break them.  The replacement " +
    "cost seemed steep and my webmates suggested the Buells which are much more flexible.  If you’re wondering " +
    "what happened to the originals see the section on Motorcycle School.";

var text_string_18 = "<b>Footpegs</b> - The OEM footpegs aren’t bad but they are more like a post then a pedel.  " +
    "I had purchased a pair of lowering plates from adventuretech.biz to give my knees a more open resting position " +
    "however, when I lowered the bike then my left toe started touching the pavement if I shifted up during a tight " +
    "left turn.  Oops.  End of plate.  So I put the pegs back to the original height but bought the new ones so my " +
    "foot rests in a natural position.  So far I really like them.";

var text_string_19 = "<b>Forkbrace</b> - I had seen mention on the web of a forkbrace for this bike.  Years ago " +
    "when I took a long bicycle ride dragging a trailer I could feel the flex in the forks even though I had " +
    "mountain bike forks.  Since I knew this bike would be heavily loaded I went for the brace before " +
    "feeling any flex.";
