var text_string_02 = "I’ve been involved in pre-hospital emergency medical care for many years so I’m well aware of " +
    "injuries associated when motor vehicle crashes.  If I start looking like a water bottle bounced off a bicycle " +
    "on rough pavement, or if I’m the pin ball ricocheting off inanimate or animate objects, when all the motion " +
    "stops I’m hoping to stand up on intact bones covered with unmarred skin and have the brain power left to talk " +
    "about what just happened.   And so, with that image in mind here’s what I’ve acquired for this trip.";

var text_string_02a = "<h3>Brain Bucket</h3>";
var text_string_03 = "For this long a trip I really wanted a modular helmet to make it easier to chat without " +
    "removing my helmet every time we stop. (With a modular helmet you can flip up the chin section without taking " +
    "the whole thing off.) I tried on every model I could find but if you happen have a ‘long oval’ shape to your " +
    "skull very few helmets fit.  Since I couldn’t reshape my head I bought the only thing that fit it.  " +
    "(Fortunately that choice isn't a high quality option.)";

var text_string_04 = "Arai Signet Q.  All white, full face, chin vent, two top vents, 2 face shield vents, plus the " +
    "pinlock inner visor.  To this I’ve added a visor, Super-Visor, (super-visor.com) The visor got added after an " +
    "early morning training ride when I turned a corner on a back road, was completely blinded by sunrise and was " +
    "unable to distinguish any of the ground and trees ahead of me.";

var text_string_05 = "<h3>Skid-wear</h3>";
var text_string_06 = "The truth is that in a car you only need to be wearing the seatbelt for one or two moments in " +
    "your life.  If you knew when those moments were you’d only have to put on your belt on a couple of days in your " +
    "life.  The problem is, if you get the timing wrong the results can be devastating";
var text_string_07 = "I think motorcycle clothes are to motorcycling what a seatbelt is to the car. (Of course " +
    "motorcycle outerwear has the additional task of fending off the elements so there are a few extra days when " +
    "it is needed.)";
var text_string_08 = "I put my seatbelt on every time I ride in a vehicle and when I motorcycle I ascribe to the " +
    "ATG-ATT philosophy, All The Gear- All The Time. For some people it may seem like too much stuff to bother with, " +
    "but being a hockey goalie, to me it doesn’t really seem like much stuff at all.";
var text_string_09 = "Years ago when I rode a motorcycle I simply wore blue jeans plus my Father’s old fire chief’s " +
    "turnout coat.  (pic) Although leather is still standard skid-wear, manufacturers have designed and motorcyclists " +
    "have tested lots of new materials.  I started by watching videos of Anthony from Revzilla.  (revzilla.com) " +
    "Anthony taught me more about clothes in a couple hours of YouTube video clips than I ever could have learned " +
    "in an entire summer of shopping. (When you live in the middle of nowhere you can’t just swing by a nearby store.)";

    "and inner spray skirt. I’ve replaced the back and elbow pads with D3o pads plus added a D3o pad in the scapular " +
    "area.  I ordered a medium to give me room for warm jackets underneath plus my chest protector.  It comes with a " +
    "good liner but I am bringing a number of other layering options to go underneath as needed.";
var text_string_12 = "<h3>Chest Protector - Forcefield</h3>";
var text_string_13 = "The Forcefield rib protector wraps around most of my chest and shortly after putting it on I " +
    "don’t notice it.  After spending a chunk of cash on a high quality helmet it made no sense not to pad my ‘vital " +
    "organs’. Johnson Leathers (johnsonleather.com) on the west coast carry the Forcefield line.";
var text_string_14 = "<h3>Outer Pant - Leather</h3>";
var text_string_15 = "The pant search has been frustrating.  I started with the FirstGear Women’s HT overpant.  They " +
    "felt like I was wearing 3 ski pants at one time.  My second choice was the Olympia Ranger 3. Although these were " +
    "relatively good quality pant I could never get them to sit astride the bike without the crotch hanging up.   " +
    "Mid-summer last year I found a used pair of Tourmaster Caliber pants and used them for the remainder of last " +
    "year.  They work fine but I still felt like I’m wearing ski pants in the summer.  Now I have a great leather " +
    "overpant that a nice lady on ebay sold me.  They are Chrome Gear, made by Custom Chrome  (and I think that " +
    "company is out of business).  They came already broken in and are very comfortable.";

var text_string_17 = "I found a used pair of Bohn stretch pants on ebay, then I took out the bulky thigh and hip pads, " +
    "joined the compartment and put in a D3o back protector.  (Revzilla)  Now the pads cover my greater tuberosity, " +
    "which is the pointy part of my femur on the side of my thigh, and is the most likely point of contact if my hip " +
    "goes to ground.  I know this spot intimately because I’ve been both a soccer goalie and hockey goalie.  (I also " +
    "know this bone breaks even in young people as my brother will attest when he cornered his road bicycle and it " +
    "slid out).  The kneepad is the original elbow pad from my jacket, however it wraps around my bony knees much " +
    "better that the Bohn one does.";

    "listening to a radio broadcast about and new lower leg orthotic, and the young man using it out had been struck " +
    "by a car from the side while he was on his motorcycle. I realized my hunting boots might not be up for that event. " +
    "After looking around for an appropriate long distance but protective boot I found a great deal at " +
    "<a href='http://www.bikebandit.com'>Bikebandit</a>. All the reviewers mentioned ‘narrow boot’ so I took a chance" +
    " on fit and it did. (I have the longest skinniest foot imaginable.)  They feel great right out of the box.";

var text_string_21 = "We’ll see soon if I’ve got this covered.  My jacket is supposedly waterproof.  I have " +
    "Gore-Tex-shell ski pants that fit over my leathers.  I found a Frogtogg 2-piece suit at a great price at " +
    "<a href='http://sierratradingpost.com'>Sierra Trading Post</a>. I’m sure I’ll have comments on my rainwear " +
